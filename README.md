# Trashy Towers

A Tricky Towers inspired game where you have to stack trash with your roommates until someone spills it.

Entry for the [Ludum Dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50) with the theme "Delay the inevitable".

## "Story"

Taking out the trash is a pretty annoyng chore.  
You've gotta put on street clothes and go into this terrifying place called "outside".  
That's why in many living arrangements, this is procrastinated until the trash spills out of the can.  
By smartly placing your trash you can "delay the inevitable" spilling until hopefully someone else spills it so that it's their problem.  
This is a game about that.

## Game modes

### Single

Play alone to beat your highscore.  
This may be the least fun mode of play but since having friends around to play games is a rare privilege, there had to be some way to try the game alone.

If you somehow can (Parsec/ actually meeting people/ whatever else) also try the other modes!

### Chaos

A chaotic mode in which you and your friend(s) try to put trash in the same can simultaniously.  
Whoever has dropped the last piece before the heap spills looses.

### Hotseat

Take turns with your firend(s) putting trash in the same can.  
Whoever has dropped the last piece before the heap spills looses.
